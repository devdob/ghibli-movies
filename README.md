###App to retrieve list of movies from Ghibli Productions API

# Setup

Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/devdob/ghibli-movies.git`

Run docker compose
`docker-compose build`

Launch
`docker-compose up -d`

Once done, navigate to `localhost:8000/movies`

It might take up to a minute after initial launch until the DB is filled with data from the API.
